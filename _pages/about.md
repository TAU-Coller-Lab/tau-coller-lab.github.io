The **Coller Lab** is a research group at the [Coller School of Management](https://www.tau.ac.il/), Tel Aviv University, working at the intersection of artificial intelligence and business analytics.

Our research focuses on developing machine learning and data-driven methods to understand complex organizational phenomena, improve decision-making, and extract actionable insights from large-scale data. We collaborate closely with industry and government partners to ensure our work has real-world impact.

We are always looking for motivated students and collaborators. If you are interested in working with us, please [get in touch](mailto:TheCollerLab@gmail.com).
